This Python script searches for Magic the Gathering cards and displays their name, cmc, mana cost, type line, oracle text, power toughness and flavor text.
In order to use this script, you first need to download python. (disregard this step if you already have it)
Then, go to this link: https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data, and download "oracle cards". 
Then put the json. file you've just downloaded and the python script into the same directory/folder. 
Open terminal, navigate to the directory where the python script is located, and run it. ($ python3 file_name.py)
